"We're seeing very strong momentum and positive customer feedback across our health care offerings. As we continue our mission to make health care simpler for customers, we're realigning some resources to help accelerate our efforts to deliver the best experience for our patients, customers, and members," Lindsay said in the statement.

"Unfortunately, these adjustments will result in the elimination of a few hundred roles within Amazon Pharmacy and One Medical. We're grateful to these team members for their contributions, and we will support them in their next steps. We will continue hiring providers and investing in teams and technology that will help us provide high-quality and accessible care to more people,"
